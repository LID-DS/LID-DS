# CVE-2012-2122 Improperly checked token comparison leads to root database access with wrong password

## Description / Overview of scenario
Oracle MySQL, when running in certain environments with certain implementations of the memcmp function, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by repeatedly authenticating with the same incorrect password, which eventually causes a token comparison to succeed due to an improperly-checked return value.

## victim:
The victim is a docker container directly taken from vulhub including the corresponding vulnerability. More information at https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub.

## normal:
The normal behaviour logs in to the database as user and then performs random SQL statements like INSERT and SELECT.

## exploit:
The exploit works by repeatedly trying to log in as root to the mysql console. Because of the vulnerablity the login with a wrong password works with a certain probability, when the login succeeds the exploit stops logging in.

There are two additional parameters when an exploit shall be recorded:

* Parameter 4 (speed): 
  * sets the time between login attempts
  * n = normal speed, no sleep
  * s = slow speed, sleep 1 second after every login attempt
  * v = very slow speed, sleep 5 seconds after every login attempt
* Parameter 5 (extract): 
  * set to 1 if after successful login username and password shall be dumped from the hacked database
