# CVE-2017-7529 Integer Overflow Vulnerability in nginx leading to data leak

## Description / Overview of scenario
Nginx versions since 0.5.6 up to and including 1.13.2 are vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerability in nginx range filter module resulting into leak of potentially sensitive information triggered by specially crafted request. 

## victim:
The victim runs ubuntu 14:04 in a docker container with nginx 1.6.3. It hosts the unapp, a simple website with some landingpages extracted from a zip file while building the container. Nginx 1.6.3 is vulnerable to the corresponding exploit.

## normal:
The normal behaviour is built as a selenium auto clicker that in the first step opens the website, iterates through available links and picks and clicks one randomly. Thereby the random surfer excludes pages that lead away from the unapp to ensure all user behaviour happens on the victim.

## exploit:
The exploit crafts a request with the overflowed content range and sends it to the vulnerable victim which leads to the integer overflow induced data leak. After that the extracted hex data leak gets printed to the console.

## cli:

    sudo python3 main.py a b c
    
    a: boolean (0/1) run automated normal behavior
    b: integer recording time
       1-n: recording time in seconds
        -1: flag to run auto stop of recording after end of exploit
    c: boolean (0/1) run automated exploit
